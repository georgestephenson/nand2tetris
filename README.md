# Nand2Tetris

There are my implementations of the `nand2tetris` projects while reading *The Elements of Computing Systems (second edition) by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schoken (MIT Press)*.

The repository is based on my download of the [Nand to Tetris Software package](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software), freely available under the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). This is now considered the "legacy desktop version" of the Java programs required to run the code, I've chosen these over the online IDE so the repo self-contains everything needed to run the projects outside of the Java run-time environment itself. This version also feels closest to the tools described in the second edition of the paperback textbook I am reading.

Below is my checklist tracking completion of the projects.
